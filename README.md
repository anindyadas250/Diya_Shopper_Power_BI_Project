# Diya_Shopper_Power_BI_Project

Worked on Power Bi on the data from Diya Shoppers, a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Used the entire business intelligence workflow:

1. Connecting and shaping the data.

2. Building a relational model.

3. Adding calculated fields.

4. Designing an interactive report.
